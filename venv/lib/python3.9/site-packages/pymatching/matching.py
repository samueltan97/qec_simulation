        r"""Constructor for the Matching class

        Parameters
        ----------
        H : `scipy.spmatrix` or `numpy.ndarray` or `networkx.Graph` object, optional
            The quantum code to be decoded with minimum-weight perfect
            matching, given either as a binary check matrix (scipy sparse 
            matrix or numpy.ndarray), or as a matching graph (NetworkX graph).
            Each edge in the NetworkX graph can have optional
            attributes ``fault_ids``, ``weight`` and ``error_probability``. 
            ``fault_ids`` should be an int or a set of ints.
            Each fault id corresponds to a self-inverse fault that is flipped when the
            corresponding edge is flipped. These self-inverse faults could correspond to
            physical Pauli errors (physical frame changes)
            or to the logical observables that are flipped by the fault
            (a logical frame change, equivalent to an obersvable ID in an error instruction in a Stim
            detector error model). The `fault_ids` attribute was previously named `qubit_id` in an
            earlier version of PyMatching, and `qubit_id` is still accepted instead of `fault_ids` in order
            to maintain backward compatibility.
            Each ``weight`` attribute should be a non-negative float. If 
            every edge is assigned an error_probability between zero and one, 
            then the ``add_noise`` method can be used to simulate noise and 
            flip edges independently in the graph. By default, None
        spacelike_weights : float or numpy.ndarray, optional
            If `H` is given as a scipy or numpy array, `spacelike_weights` gives the weights
            of edges in the matching graph corresponding to columns of `H`.
            If spacelike_weights is a numpy.ndarray, it should be a 1D array with length
            equal to `H.shape[1]`. If spacelike_weights is a float, it is used as the weight for all
            edges corresponding to columns of `H`. By default None, in which case
            all weights are set to 1.0
        error_probabilities : float or numpy.ndarray, optional
            The probabilities with which an error occurs on each edge corresponding
            to a column of the check matrix. If a
            single float is given, the same error probability is used for each 
            edge. If a numpy.ndarray of floats is given, it must have a
            length equal to the number of columns in the check matrix H. This parameter is only
            needed for the Matching.add_noise method, and not for decoding. 
            By default None
        repetitions : int, optional
            The number of times the stabiliser measurements are repeated, if 
            the measurements are noisy. This option is only used if `H` is 
            provided as a check matrix, not a NetworkX graph. By default None
        timelike_weights : float, optional
            If `H` is given as a scipy or numpy array and `repetitions>1`, 
            `timelike_weights` gives the weight of timelike edges.
            If a float is given, all timelike edges weights are set to
            the same value. If a numpy array of size `(H.shape[0],)` is given, the
            edge weight for each vertical timelike edge associated with the `i`th check (row)
            of `H` is set to `timelike_weights[i]`. By default None, in which case all
            timelike weights are set to 1.0
        measurement_error_probabilities : float, optional
            If `H` is given as a scipy or numpy array and `repetitions>1`, 
            gives the probability of a measurement error to be used for 
            the add_noise method. If a float is given, all measurement
            errors are set to the same value. If a numpy array of size `(H.shape[0],)` is given,
            the error probability for each vertical timelike edge associated with the `i`th check
            (row) of `H` is set to `measurement_error_probabilities[i]`. By default None
        precompute_shortest_paths : bool, optional
            It is almost always recommended to leave this as False. If 
            the exact matching is used for decoding (setting 
            `num_neighbours=None` in `decode`), then setting this option
            to True will precompute the all-pairs shortest paths.
            By default False

        Load a matching graph from a check matrix

        Parameters
        ----------
        H : `scipy.spmatrix` or `numpy.ndarray` or List[List[int]]
            The quantum code to be decoded with minimum-weight perfect
            matching, given as a binary check matrix (scipy sparse
            matrix or numpy.ndarray)
        spacelike_weights : float or numpy.ndarray, optional
            If `H` is given as a scipy or numpy array, `spacelike_weights` gives the weights
            of edges in the matching graph corresponding to columns of `H`.
            If spacelike_weights is a numpy.ndarray, it should be a 1D array with length
            equal to `H.shape[1]`. If spacelike_weights is a float, it is used as the weight for all
            edges corresponding to columns of `H`. By default None, in which case
            all weights are set to 1.0
        error_probabilities : float or numpy.ndarray, optional
            The probabilities with which an error occurs on each edge associated with a
            column of H. If a
            single float is given, the same error probability is used for each
            column. If a numpy.ndarray of floats is given, it must have a
            length equal to the number of columns in H. This parameter is only
            needed for the Matching.add_noise method, and not for decoding.
            By default None
        repetitions : int, optional
            The number of times the stabiliser measurements are repeated, if
            the measurements are noisy. By default None
        timelike_weights : float or numpy.ndarray, optional
            If `repetitions>1`, `timelike_weights` gives the weight of
            timelike edges. If a float is given, all timelike edges weights are set to
            the same value. If a numpy array of size `(H.shape[0],)` is given, the
            edge weight for each vertical timelike edge associated with the `i`th check (row)
            of `H` is set to `timelike_weights[i]`. By default None, in which case all
            timelike weights are set to 1.0
        measurement_error_probabilities : float or numpy.ndarray, optional
            If `repetitions>1`, gives the probability of a measurement
            error to be used for the add_noise method. If a float is given, all measurement
            errors are set to the same value. If a numpy array of size `(H.shape[0],)` is given,
            the error probability for each vertical timelike edge associated with the `i`th check
            (row) of `H` is set to `measurement_error_probabilities[i]`. This argument can also be
            given using the keyword argument `measurement_error_probability` to maintain backward
            compatibility with previous versions of Pymatching. By default None

        syndrome weight in a connected component is odd, and the same connected component does not
        have a boundary node, then a `ValueError` is raised.

        Parameters
        ----------
        z : numpy.ndarray
            A binary syndrome vector to decode. The number of elements in 
            `z` should equal the number of nodes in the matching graph. If 
            `z` is a 1D array, then `z[i]` is the syndrome at node `i` of 
            the matching graph. If `z` is 2D then `z[i,j]` is the difference 
            (modulo 2) between the (noisy) measurement of stabiliser `i` in time 
            step `j+1` and time step `j` (for the case where the matching graph is
            constructed from a check matrix with `repetitions>1`).
        num_neighbours : int, optional
            Number of closest neighbours (with non-trivial syndrome) of each matching
            graph node to consider when decoding. If `num_neighbours` is set
            (as it is by default), then the local matching decoder in
            https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13082 is used, and `num_neighbours`
            corresponds to the parameter `m` in the paper. It is recommended 
            to leave `num_neighbours` set to at least 20.
            If `num_neighbours is None`, then instead full matching is 
            performed, with the all-pairs shortest paths precomputed and 
            cached the first time it is used. Since full matching is more 
            memory intensive, it is not recommended to be used for matching graphs 
            with more than around 10,000 nodes, and is only faster than 
            local matching for matching graphs with less than around 1,000 
            nodes. By default 30
        return_weight : bool, optional
            If `return_weight==True`, the sum of the weights of the edges in the 
            minimum weight perfect matching is also returned. By default False

        Returns
        -------
        correction : numpy.ndarray or list[int]
            A 1D numpy array of ints giving the minimum-weight correction operator as a 
            binary vector. The number of elements in `correction` is one greater than
            the largest fault ID. The ith element of `correction` is 1 if the 
            minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) found by PyMatching contains an odd 
            number of edges that have `i` as one of the `fault_ids`, and is 0 otherwise.
            If each edge in the matching graph is assigned a unique integer in its 
            `fault_ids` attribute, then the locations of nonzero entries in `correction` 
            correspond to the edges in the MWPM. However, `fault_ids` can instead be used, 
            for example, to store IDs of the physical or logical frame changes that occur 
            when an edge flips (see the documentation for ``Matching.add_edge`` for more information).
        weight : float
            Present only if `return_weight==True`.
            The sum of the weights of the edges in the minimum-weight perfect 
            matching.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> import pymatching
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> H = np.array([[1, 1, 0, 0],
        ...               [0, 1, 1, 0],
        ...               [0, 0, 1, 1]])
        >>> m = pymatching.Matching(H)
        >>> z = np.array([0, 1, 0])
        >>> m.decode(z)
        array([1, 1, 0, 0], dtype=uint8)

        Each bit in the correction provided by Matching.decode corresponds to a
        fault_ids. The index of a bit in a correction corresponds to its fault_ids.
        For example, here an error on edge (0, 1) flips fault_ids 2 and 3, as
        inferred by the minimum-weight correction:
        >>> import pymatching
        >>> m = pymatching.Matching()
        >>> m.add_edge(0, 1, fault_ids={2, 3})
        >>> m.add_edge(1, 2, fault_ids=1)
        >>> m.add_edge(2, 0, fault_ids=0)
        >>> m.decode([1, 1, 0])
        array([0, 0, 1, 1], dtype=uint8)

        To decode with a phenomenological noise model (qubits and measurements both suffering
        bit-flip errors), you can provide a check matrix and number of syndrome repetitions to
        construct a matching graph with a time dimension (where nodes in consecutive time steps
        are connected by an edge), and then decode with a 2D syndrome
        (dimension 0 is space, dimension 1 is time):
        >>> import pymatching
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> np.random.seed(0)
        >>> H = np.array([[1, 1, 0, 0],
        ...               [0, 1, 1, 0],
        ...               [0, 0, 1, 1]])
        >>> m = pymatching.Matching(H, repetitions=5)
        >>> data_qubit_noise = (np.random.rand(4, 5) < 0.1).astype(np.uint8)
        >>> print(data_qubit_noise)
        [[0 0 0 0 0]
         [0 0 0 0 0]
         [0 0 0 0 1]
         [1 1 0 0 0]]
        >>> cumulative_noise = (np.cumsum(data_qubit_noise, 1) % 2).astype(np.uint8)
        >>> syndrome = H@cumulative_noise % 2
        >>> print(syndrome)
